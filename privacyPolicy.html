	   <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	   <small>
	   	  Your privacy is important to Apple. So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, 
	   	  disclose, transfer, and store your information. 
	   	  Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.
	   </small>

		<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
		<p>Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.</p>
		<p>
			You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple 
			affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it 
			consistent with this Privacy Policy. 
			They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
		</p>
		<h2>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
		<p>
			We also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. 
			We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the 
			combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
		<p>
			Apple’s website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, 
			and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.
			 These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people
			  have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. 
			  We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. 
			  However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are 
			  considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. 
			  Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we 
			  treat the combined information 
			as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control
the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness
 of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can
  opt out by accessing the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue 
  to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your 
  interests. You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other 
  non-personal information. This opt-out applies only to 
			Apple advertising services and does not affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use
			 our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with 
			 Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time 
			 you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school −
			  helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device
			   has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email 
			   communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, product serial numbers, 
			   and information about your computer or device helps us register your products, 
			personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.
